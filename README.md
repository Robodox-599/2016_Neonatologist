### Subsystems (as of 3/14/16 - Happy Ï€ day!):
####Drive:
         - The drive system is based on tank drive. (There are beautiful green treads)
         - There are two shift states, A and B. 
####Intake:
         - The intake requires 3 motors, two on the base in order to pivot the system and one 
           on the roller to physically intake the ball.
         - Two encoders are used in order to lock the system at 45 degrees when driving around
           the field. 
####Shooter:
         - The shooter is activated by two buttons, one to shoot and one to reset the subsystem.
           The shoot button engages a piston then resets an encoder. The reset button activates
           a sequence as follows: spin motor forward, engage piston, then reset the encoder. The
           piston is used to switch gears on the gearbox. 
         - A limit switch is used to prevent the shooter from going too far back.
