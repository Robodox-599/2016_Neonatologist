### Subsystems (as of 3/09/16):
####Intake:
         - The intake requires 3 motors, two on the base in order to pivot the system and one 
           on the roller to physically intake the ball.
         - Two encoders are used in order to lock the system at 45 degrees when driving around
           the field. 
####Shooter:
         - The shooter is activated by two buttons, one to shoot and one to reset the subsystem.
           The shoot button engages a piston then resets an encoder. The reset button activates
           a sequence as follows: spin motor forward, engage piston, then reset the encoder. The
           piston is used to switch gears on the gearbox. 
         - A limit switch is used to prevent the shooter from going too far back.
         - In the future, this code may be condensed down into one button that activates a 
           sequence with an automatic reset. 
####Lift:
######This subsystem's code is temporarily on hold because the lift's construction is postponed until after every other subsystem is built. The other subsystems have precedence over this code, so we will probably resume with this towards the end of Build Season.
**Lifting the Portcullis:**

         - Two buttons, one to open and close the pistons (3). 
         - Three pistons are used to lift the gate (two programmed solenoids), both opening and 
           closing simultaneously. One piston opens in order to physically lift the gate while
           the other two activate in order to kick up a flat, smooth surface to allow the robot 
           to drive under the gate as it slides down. 
**Lifting the Robot:**

         - In order to lift the robot, three motors are used in total. Two motors attach to a 
           a winch/drum while the other attaches to a pair of tape measures. Yes. Tape measures. 
         - The tape measures are attached to the winch in order to guide it along the stronghold. 
           The winch then guides a hook up to the bar, latches on, and then the robot ascends to 
           the heavens. 
         - In simpler terms (of guiding?): tape measures -> winch -> stronghold bar.
