## NEONATOLOGIST 2K16
### Autonomous
(2016-01-20)
As of now, we only have one planned autonomous mode.
The robot will:
1. Move a preloaded boulder into the shooter system
2. Drive under the low bar
3. Turn `x` degrees (not decided yet)
4. Shoot boulder towards the high goal

#### TODO
- figure out length of time for each auto step
