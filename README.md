### Subsystems (as of 1/25/16):
####Intake:
         - The intake requires 3 motors, two on the base in order to pivot the system and one 
           on the roller to physically intake the ball.
         - Two encoders are used in order to lock the system at 45 degrees when driving around
           the field. 
####Shooter:
         - The shooter is activated by two buttons, one to shoot and one to reset the subsystem.
           The shoot button engages a piston then resets an encoder. The reset button activates
           a sequence as follows: spin motor forward, engage piston, then reset the encoder. The
           piston is used to switch gears on the gearbox. 
         - An encoder is used in order to measure the distance taken upon pulling the system
           backwards. It will reset after every shot taken. 
         - In the future, this code may be condensed down into one button that activates a 
           sequence with an automatic reset. 
####Lift:
**Lifting the Portcullis:**

         - Two buttons, one to open and close the pistons. 
         - Two pistons are used to lift the gate, both opening and closing simultaneously. One
           piston opens in order to physically lift the gate while the other activates in order 
           to kick up a flat, smooth surface to allow the robot to drive under the gate as it 
           slides down. 
**Lifting the Robot:**

         - Two buttons, they are held down in order to manually move the tape measures. Yes. 
           I'm not kidding. I said tape measures. 
         - Two motors are attached to a winch. The winch guides a hook used to latch on to the 
           bar on top of the tower. There is one more motor powering two pairs of tape measurers 
           that guide the the winch / hook system to the bar.
         - In simpler terms: tape measures -> winch -> bar.
